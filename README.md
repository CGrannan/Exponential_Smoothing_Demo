This repository is meant to go along with a blog post tutorial on how to create exponential smoothing models for time series analysis. You can find the blog post located [here](https://chrisgrannan.medium.com/time-series-analysis-with-exponential-smoothing-d3ad82d47ab0). The data used for this walkthrough pertains to beer production rates from 1955 to 1995 and was obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shenba/time-series-datasets?select=monthly-beer-production-in-austr.csv). The walkthrough covers simple exponential smoothing, Holt's method for double exponential smoothing and the Holt-Winter method of triple exponential smoothing.
